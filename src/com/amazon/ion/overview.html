IonJava is the reference implementation of the
<a href="http://w.amazon.com/?Ion">Ion data notation</a> for the
Java<sup><font size="-4">TM</font></sup> 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0
and above.
<p>
This document describes all classes intended for public consumption, limited to
the packages {@link com.amazon.ion}, {@link com.amazon.ion.system}, and
{@link com.amazon.ion.util}.  The distribution includes other implementation
packages not documented here (<em>e.g.</em> {@code com.amazon.ion.impl});
your use of those packages is not supported, so <b>don't use them!</b>


<h1>Start at IonSystem</h1>

The central interface in IonJava is {@link com.amazon.ion.IonSystem}, which is
the main factory and facade for all Ion processing.
The intended architectural pattern is for your application to acquire a
single system instance from the 
{@link com.amazon.ion.system.SystemFactory SystemFactory} and use it
throughout the application.  The {@code IonSystem} interface provides access
to all other components, including the capability to construct
{@link com.amazon.ion.IonValue IonValue} hierarchies.  Note that objects
returned by one {@code IonSystem} cannot by mixed with objects returned by
another {@code IonSystem}!  For example, the following code is <b>not
guaranteed to work</b>:

<pre>
    IonSystem sys1 = SystemFactory.newSystem();
    IonSystem sys2 = SystemFactory.newSystem();
    
    IonList parent = sys1.newEmptyList();
    IonInt  child  = sys1.newInt(23);
    parent.add(child);
</pre>


<h1>Getting Data In</h1>

This release defines two mechanisms for accepting Ion data:
<ul>
  <li>{@link com.amazon.ion.IonLoader IonLoader} loads an entire input stream
    into a single {@linkplain com.amazon.ion.IonDatagram datagram}.
    This "all at once" input mechanism is intended for document-oriented
    applications.
  </li>
  <li>Iteration reads an input stream by
    iterating over its top-level elements.  This "one at a time" input
    mechanism is intended for stream-oriented applications.
  </li>
</ul>

Each mechanism accepts either text or binary Ion data, and applications should
rarely care about the input format.
<p>
To construct an {@code IonLoader}, call
{@link com.amazon.ion.IonSystem#newLoader()} and configure it as necessary.
You can reuse a loader many times, even from multiple threads.  The system
factory also maintains a "default loader" so you don't have to pass one around,
see {@link com.amazon.ion.IonSystem#getLoader()}.
<p>
In contrast, iterators are not reusable: they are extensions of
{@link java.util.Iterator} so they are used once and then discarded.
Use the various {@code iterate()} factory methods on {@code IonSystem} to
create iterators.
<p>
<b>Note:</b> There is currently no SAX- or StAX-like mechanism for fine-grained
streaming.
